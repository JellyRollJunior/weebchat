## Reflection

This app is based on Kotlin Messenger app by Let's Build That App with a couple of key improvements which include:
 - ViewModel to store user data instead of parcelable extras
 - NavGraph to control fragment navigation instead of using activities
 - Data Binding and View Binding to promote cleaner code 
 - Using Material Design UI components whenever possible
 - Separating database operations to a helper class whenever possible

This was my first experience using Firebase and honestly, it was a lot more straightforward than I thought. 
This is a very powerful tool :) that makes backend a lot more simple.
